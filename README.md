# welcome to my app

questions:
## how do i use it
import a video with ctrl+a, select start and end times, export with ctrl+s

## my video didnt get saved
idk lol

## this is literally just an ffmpeg command runner
yep i made it for my own use

## the start of the video is frozen
yeah i cant seem to get ffmpeg to not do that and also export an actual video. i might look into it more

## this is ugly as shit
i know

## did you vibe code this
copilot was absolutely used but tbf i stole a lot of it from the wxpython hello world tutorial
i didnt have copilot do the hard stuff for me it just was consulted for errors and syntax and would autofill for me often so i said may as well 
but the ideas are my own and i could explain any part of the code

## this code is messy af 
lol 

## why would i ever need this
i made this because the windows built-in video trimmer kept giving a super washed-out look to my clips and i didnt feel like remembering ffmpeg commands 
also just wanted buttons for start and end time

## wheres the exe
ask me
